# Library Manager
## Project Overview
This program built in Python is designed to be a simply command-line-based 
small library management system. It allows users to add new books, list all 
books previously added, and search for specific books by title or author. 

## Features
This program has the following features:
1. Add Book: Prompts the user for a book's title, author, and ISBN and adds it 
to the library.
2. List Books: Displays the details of all books currently in the library.
3. Find Book: Searches for a book by title or author.
4. Modular Design: The project is split into two files (book.py and 
library_manager.py) to demonstrate modular programming and improve code 
organization.

## Different Files
There are two files in this directory. 
1. book.py: Defines the Book class, which serves as a blueprint for creating 
book objects. 
2. library_manager.py: Contains the main program logic, including functions to 
manage the library's inventory. It has a menu-driven interface to interact with 
the system.

## How to Run the Program
1. To run this program: Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone repository: Clone this repository to your local computer using Git.
   - git clone [https://github.com/shearr-csp/Introduction-to-Python/tree/main/Library%20Management%20System]
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   - cd Introduction-to-Python/Library Management System
      - You might need to put () around Library Management System if you get the 
        "too many arguments" error. 
4. Run the program:
   - python3 library_manager.py
